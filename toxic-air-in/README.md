# Race & Toxic Air Polution in NW Indiana, 2017  
This map was created as part of a master's level cartography course at the University of Arizona. The map analyzes the relationship between toxic air pollution and race/ethnicity in three northwest Indiana counties. Toxic release inventory data from the US EPA was used to perform this analysis. The results suggest Black and Latino communities in NW Indiana are more likely to be exposed to toxic air pollution than white communities.
